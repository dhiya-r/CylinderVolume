# Cylinder Volume Calculator

## Description
The `cylinder_volume.py` is a Python program that calculates the volume of a cylinder given integer values for its diameter and height. 

The program consists of three functions: `circle_area`, `cylinder_volume`, and `main`. 

- The `circle_area` function takes a diameter as a parameter and calculates and returns the area of the circle with that diameter. 
- The `cylinder_volume` function takes a diameter and a height as parameters. It calculates and returns the volume of the cylinder with that diameter and height. It calls the `circle_area` function to obtain a value for A. 
- The `main` function asks the user to input diameter and height and calls `cylinder_volume`, printing out the result. 

## How to Run
To run the program, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `cylinder.py`, and type `python cylinder.py`.
Alternately, if you have VS Code install python. Then select an interpreter by clicking Control+Shift+P and trying Python: Select Interpreter and choose one. Navigate to the directory containing `cylinder.py` and run it.
